# Supply Chain Risk Assessment API - Integration Guide

## Base URL

```
https://supply-chain-risk-api-7567b2b7e4c5.herokuapp.com
```

## Overview

This API quantifies multi-dimensional supply chain risk exposure for any country-sector combination. It integrates 5 risk dimensions with OECD Input-Output economic modeling and a **3-tier supply chain model** to assess both direct operational risk and indirect (upstream supply chain) risk across multiple layers of the supply chain.

The 5 risk dimensions are:
- **Climate** - physical climate hazard exposure
- **Modern Slavery** - forced labour and trafficking risk
- **Political Instability** - governance and political risk
- **Water Stress** - water scarcity and stress exposure
- **Nature Loss** - biodiversity and ecosystem degradation risk

All risk scores are on a scale of **0 to 5**, where 0 = lowest risk and 5 = highest risk.

### Multi-Tier Supply Chain Model

The API traces supply chain exposure through 3 tiers using OECD Input-Output coefficient tables:

| Tier | Description | Weight |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Tier 1 | Direct suppliers — the immediate upstream inputs to the queried country-sector | 50% |
| Tier 2 | Sub-suppliers — suppliers to Tier 1 suppliers, identified by cascading I-O lookups | 35% |
| Tier 3 | Deep supply chain — suppliers to Tier 2 suppliers, one further level deep | 15% |

For each tier, supplier I-O coefficients are normalised within that tier to compute coefficient-weighted risk scores. The overall **indirect risk** is the weighted combination of all three tiers' risk scores. The **total risk** blends 60% direct risk + 40% indirect risk.

Duplicate country-sector pairs across tiers are deduplicated using the maximum coefficient.

## Authentication

No authentication is required. The API is publicly accessible.

## Integration with ISIN-based Systems

The API uses **ISO-3166 country codes** (e.g., USA, GBR, CHN) and **ISIC Rev.4 sector codes** (e.g., B06, C20) as identifiers. To integrate with a system that uses ISINs as the primary company identifier, the consuming application should:

1. Extract the **country of domicile** from the ISIN (first 2 characters map to ISO-2, which should be converted to ISO-3)
2. Map the company's **primary business activity** to an ISIC sector code (e.g., using GICS, ICB, or NACE classification crosswalks)
3. Call the `/api/assess` endpoint with those two parameters

**ISIN country prefix to ISO-3 mapping examples:**

| ISIN Prefix | Country      | ISO-3 Code |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| US          | United States | USA        |
| GB          | United Kingdom | GBR      |
| DE          | Germany      | DEU        |
| JP          | Japan        | JPN        |
| FR          | France       | FRA        |
| CN          | China        | CHN        |
| AU          | Australia    | AUS        |
| BR          | Brazil       | BRA        |
| IN          | India        | IND        |
| CH          | Switzerland  | CHE        |

**Response Structure:**

> **Note:** Climate expected loss data is sourced **live** from the Climate Risk API V6 (Probabilistic Model), which uses real scientific datasets (NOAA IBTrACS, WRI Aqueduct, HadEX3). If the Climate API is temporarily unavailable, the system falls back to pre-computed static values. Results are cached for 1 hour per country to optimise response times.
>
> All financial values (annual losses, present values) are expressed in USD per **$1B asset value exposure**.

| `top_suppliers[].direct_risk` | The supplier's own country-level risk scores |
| `top_suppliers[].risk_contribution` | Risk contributed by this supplier (coefficient-weighted within its tier) |
| `top_suppliers[].expected_loss_contribution` | Financial loss attributed to this supplier (`annual_loss` and `present_value`) |

### Present Value Calculation

The `present_value` field represents the present value of a growing stream of expected losses over a specified time horizon. This accounts for the fact that climate-related losses are expected to increase over time due to climate change.

**Formula (Growing Annuity):**

```
PV = L / (r - g) × [1 - ((1 + g) / (1 + r))^T]
```

Where:
- `L` = current annual expected loss (USD)
- `r` = discount rate (default 0.10 = 10%)
- `g` = annual growth rate of losses (default 0.04 = 4%)
- `T` = time horizon in years (default 30)

**Interpretation:**
- The annual loss `L` is assumed to grow at rate `g` per year (reflecting increasing climate risk)
- Future losses are discounted at rate `r` to their present value
- The result represents the total economic cost of climate risk exposure over the time horizon, in today's dollars
- This is computed for each individual hazard type (hurricane, flood, heat stress, drought, extreme precipitation) as well as the total

**Example with defaults (10% discount, 4% growth, 30 years):**

For a country with $100M annual expected loss:
```
PV = $100M / (0.10 - 0.04) × [1 - (1.04 / 1.10)^30]
   = $100M / 0.06 × [1 - 0.8143]
   = $100M × 16.667 × 0.8143 ≈ $1,357M
```

**Customising PV parameters:**

To use a lower discount rate (e.g., 5%) with higher growth (6%) over 50 years:
```
GET /api/assess?country=USA&sector=C26&discount_rate=0.05&growth_rate=0.06&pv_horizon=50
```

> **Note:** If `discount_rate` equals `growth_rate`, the formula degenerates to `PV = L × T / (1 + r)` (a finite annuity at constant real terms).

### How Indirect Risk is Calculated

1. For each tier, supplier coefficients are normalised (summed to 1.0 within the tier)
2. Each supplier's risk scores are multiplied by their normalised coefficient
3. The tier-level risk is the sum of all coefficient-weighted supplier risks
4. The overall indirect risk = (Tier 1 risk × 0.50) + (Tier 2 risk × 0.35) + (Tier 3 risk × 0.15)
5. Total risk = (Direct risk × 0.60) + (Indirect risk × 0.40)

| NOAA IBTrACS | 131,076 hurricane records (2004-2024) | Global tropical cyclone basin data |
| WRI Aqueduct | 7,473 flood grid points, 7 return periods | Global flood risk modeling |
| HadEX3 | Temperature + precipitation extremes | Global land, 2.5 deg grid (GEV/Gamma distributions) |

**How it works:**
1. When a risk assessment is requested, the supply chain API calls the Climate Risk API's country endpoint with `asset_value = $1,000,000,000`
2. The Climate API evaluates a 9-point weighted grid across the country (center 25%, cardinals 10% each, diagonals 9% each)
3. Results are cached for 1 hour per country to reduce response times on subsequent requests
4. If the Climate API is temporarily unavailable (e.g., cold start, maintenance), the system falls back to pre-computed static values

**Response time impact:** The first request for a given country takes 20-30 seconds (Climate API processing time). Subsequent requests within the 1-hour cache window return in <100ms. Use `skip_climate=true` to bypass climate data entirely for faster responses.

## Rate Limits

No rate limits are currently enforced. Note that the first request for each country may take 20-30 seconds due to the live Climate Risk API call. For bulk assessments, results are cached for 1 hour, so subsequent requests for the same country will be fast.

## Availability

The API runs on a Heroku Basic dyno and is available 24/7 with no scheduled downtime or sleep periods. The Climate Risk API V6 also runs on Heroku (Standard-2X dyno) and is available 24/7.
